<h3><a id = "navigation">Moving the cursor</a></h3>
<p>Making text editing easier with a touch screen is a priority of TextWarrior. 
To help with that, there are five methods to choose from for positioning the cursor.</p>
<p>These can be accessed from <i>Settings → Cursor navigation</i>.</p>

<br>

<h4>Basic</h4>
<p>Tap anywhere on the text.</p>
<p>You can also touch the cursor and drag it to the desired position. 
This only works when <i>Settings → Drag select</i> is disabled.</p>
<p>The basic method is always active, even if another navigation method is chosen.</p>

<br>

<h4>Trackpad</h4>
<p>Tap the 4-arrow button at the bottom of the screen to display the trackpad.</p>
<p>To move the cursor, move in the desired direction on the trackpad.</p>
<p>Tap anywhere on the trackpad to hide it again.</p>

<br>

<h4>Yo-yo</h4>
<p>Grab the round handle dangling below the cursor and drag it in the desired direction.</p>

<br>

<h4>Liquid</h4>
<i>Available only on devices with accelerometers.</i>
<p>Press and hold the fire button at the bottom of the screen to activate liquid mode.</p>
<p>In liquid mode, the cursor can be moved by tilting the device in the desired direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Up: Screen faces the sky
<li>Down: Screen is vertical and faces you. Bottom of the screen points towards the ground.
<li>Left: Screen is tilted to the left
<li>Right: Screen is tilted to the right
<li>Rest (no movement): Screen faces you at a 45 degree angle with the ground
</ul>
<p>Release the fire button to freeze cursor movement and exit liquid mode.</p>
<p>For best results, disable automatic switching of portrait and landscape modes 
on your device. Also, avoid moving the cursor in 2 directions at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> This mode is power-intensive. Watch those battery levels!</p>

<br>

<h4>Volume keys</h4>
<p>Press the volume up/down key to move the cursor to the left/right.</p>
<p>In this mode, the volume keys will no longer control the device volume. However, 
the keys will work normally again when switching to another application.</p>

<br>

<h3><a id = "selection">Text Selection</a></h3>
<h4>Making a selection</h4>
<p>Double-tap anywhere on the text to enter selection mode.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if <i>Settings → Drag select</i> is enabled, simply touch and drag the cursor.</p>
<p>With a hardware keyboard, you can also hold shift and press any direction key.</p>
<p>In selection mode, the cursor will change into a shorter rectangle.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> After double-tapping, you can leave your finger on the screen and start changing the selection range immediately.</p>

<h4>Changing the selection range</h4>
<p>Touch and drag either end of the selection to the desired position.</p>
<p>The cursor navigation methods described above can also be used. Tap on the 
beginning or end of the selection to move the cursor there, to make it the target 
of the current navigation method.</p>
<p>With a hardware keyboard, you can also hold shift and press a direction key.</p>
</body>

<h4>Cancel a selection</h4>
<p>To exit selection mode, tap any unselected area.</p>
<p>You can also double-tap on the selected text.</p>
<p>With a hardware keyboard, you can also press any direction key.</p>
</body>

<h4>Selection properties</h4>
<p>The <i>Properties</i> option available from the main menu shows statistics related to 
the selection like word and character count. If there is no selection, statistics for the 
entire file will be shown instead.</p>
</body>

<br>

<h3><a id = "clipboard">Clipboard</a></h3>
<p>The arrow tab at the top right corner of the screen opens the clipboard.</p>
<p>Tap or drag it down to display the clipboard.</p>
<p>Tap the arrow again or drag it up to close the clipboard. 
The clipboard can also be closed by flicking it upwards.</p>

<br>

<h3><a id = "find">Find / Replace</a></h3>
<h4>Display the find and replace bars</h4>
<p>Toggle the display of the find bar by selecting "Find" on the menu.</p>
<p>Alternatively, press the "Search" button on your device if it has one.</p>
<p>The replace bar is normally hidden from view. 
To display it, click the double arrows on the left of the search text box. 
Click on it again to hide it.</p>

<h4>Button guide</h4>
<p>Magnifying glass pointing right: Search forwards</p>
<p>Magnifying glass pointing left: Search backwards</p>
<p>Looped arrow: Replace selected text</p>
<p>Multiple looped arrows: Replace all</p>
<p>Gear: Find options</p>

<br>

<h3><a id = "keyboard">Keyboard Guide</a></h3>
The following shortcuts apply to most hardware keyboards.
<p>Shift+Enter: Switch between the find/replace bar and the main text area</p>
<p>Shift+Space: Insert a tab</p>
