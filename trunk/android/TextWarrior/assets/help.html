<h2><a id = "navigation">MOVING THE CURSOR</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<p>Making text editing easier with a touch screen is always a priority of TextWarrior. 
	That's why there are five methods available for positioning the cursor,
	to suit your preferred style of working.</p>
	<p>These can be accessed from <em>Settings → Cursor navigation</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Basic</h3>
	<p>Tap anywhere on the text.</p>
	<p>You can also touch the cursor and drag it to the desired position. 
	This only works when <em>Settings → Drag select</em> is disabled.</p>
	<p>The basic method is always active, even if another navigation method is chosen.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Trackpad</h3>
	<p>Tap <span><img src="images/trackpad_open.png" alt="Minimize icon"><span>
	 at the bottom of the screen to display the trackpad.</p>
	<p>To move the cursor, move in the desired direction on the trackpad.</p>
	<p>Tap anywhere on the trackpad to hide it again.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Yo-yo</h3>
	<p>Grab the round handle dangling below the cursor and drag it in the desired direction.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Liquid</h3>
	<em>Available only on devices with accelerometers.</em>
	<p>Press and hold the fire button at the bottom of the screen to activate liquid mode.</p>
	<p>In liquid mode, the cursor can be moved by tilting the device in the desired direction.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Up: Screen faces the sky
	<li>Down: Screen is vertical and faces you. Bottom of the screen points towards the ground.
	<li>Left: Screen is tilted to the left
	<li>Right: Screen is tilted to the right
	<li>Rest (no movement): Screen faces you at a 45 degree angle with the ground
	</ul>
	<p>Release the fire button to freeze cursor movement and exit liquid mode.</p>
	<p>For best results, disable automatic switching of portrait and landscape modes 
	on your device. Also, avoid moving the cursor in 2 directions at the same time.</p>
	<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This mode is power-intensive. Watch those battery levels!</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Volume keys</h3>
	<p>Press the volume up/down key to move the cursor to the right/left.</p>
	<p>In this mode, the volume keys will no longer control the device volume. However, 
	the keys will work normally again when switching to another application.</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "selection">TEXT SELECTION</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Making a selection</h3>
	<p>Double-tap anywhere on the text to enter selection mode.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, if <em>Settings → Drag select</em> is enabled, simply touch and drag the cursor.</p>
	<p>With a hardware keyboard, you can also hold shift and press any direction key.</p>
	<p>In selection mode, the cursor will change into a shorter rectangle.</p>
	<p><strong>Tip:</strong> After double-tapping, you can leave your finger on the screen and start changing the selection range immediately.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Changing the selection range</h3>
	<p>Drag either end of the selection to the desired position.</p>
	<p>The cursor navigation methods described above can also be used. Tap on the 
	beginning or end of the selection to move the cursor there, to make it the target 
	of the current navigation method.</p>
	<p>With a hardware keyboard, you can also hold shift and press a direction key.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Cancel a selection</h3>
	<p>To exit selection mode, tap any unselected area.</p>
	<p>You can also double-tap on the selected text.</p>
	<p>With a hardware keyboard, you can also press any direction key.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Selection properties</h3>
	<p>The <em>Properties</em> option available from the main menu shows statistics related to 
	the selection like word and character count. If there is no selection, statistics for the 
	entire file will be shown instead.</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "clipboard">CLIPBOARD</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<p>The arrow tab at the top right corner of the screen opens the clipboard.</p>
	<p>Tap or drag it down to display the clipboard.</p>
	<p>Tap the arrow again or drag it up to close the clipboard. 
	The clipboard can also be closed by flicking it upwards.</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "find">FIND / REPLACE</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Display the find and replace bars</h3>
	<p>Toggle the display of the find bar by selecting "Find" on the menu.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, press the "Search" button on your device if it has one.</p>
	<p>The replace bar is normally hidden from view. 
	To display it, tap <span><img src="images/arrow_down.png" alt="Double arrows down"><span>
	at the left of the search text box. Tap it again to hide the replace bar.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>Button guide</h3>
	<p><span><img src="images/find_forwards.png"><span> Search forwards</p>
	<p><span><img src="images/find_backwards.png"><span> Search backwards</p>
	<p><span><img src="images/replace.png"><span> Replace selected text</p>
	<p><span><img src="images/replace_all.png"><span> Replace all</p>
	<p><span><img src="images/settings.png"><span> Find options</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "keyboard">HARDWARE KEYBOARD GUIDE</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	The following shortcuts apply to most hardware keyboards.
	<p>Shift + Enter: Switch between the find/replace bar and the main text area</p>
	<p>Shift + Space: Insert a tab</p>
	<p>Long-press of alphabetical key: Capitalizes the letter, if 
		<em>Settings → Long-press caps</em> is enabled</p>
</div>


<h2><a id = "backup">BACKUP AND DATA RECOVERY</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Auto-backup</h3>
<p>This feature allows unsaved changes to be recovered if the Android system
	forces TextWarrior to close. Auto-backup can be enabled or disabled in 
	the app settings. It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> to leave this
	feature enabled.
</p>
<p>For auto-backup to work correctly, always ensure there is sufficient space on
	your device or SD card.
</p>
<p>You should not rely exclusively on auto-backup. Always save critical changes
	when you have the chance.
</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>I lost my unsaved data. Can it be recovered?</h3>
<p>If auto-backup is disabled when the data was lost, it cannot be recovered.
	If auto-backup is enabled, there is still hope.
	<ul>
	<li>Firstly, if a file with unsaved changes is currently open in TextWarrior,
		<em>save it now!</em> Leaving an unsaved file open will cause backups of
		it to be made, which might eventually overwrite the backup you want to
		recover.
	<li>Do not uninstall or update TextWarrior. These actions will delete all backups.
	<li>Next, check the files in this directory:
		<span class="code">&lt;external store&gt;/Android/data/com.myopicmobile.textwarrior.android/files</span>.
		Substitute <span class="code">&lt;external store&gt;</span> for the 
		external storage on your device. For most devices, this is the SD card.
	<li>Backup files are named backup0.txt, backup1.txt, backup2.txt ... Note that
		a higher number does not always imply a newer file. Check the file
		modification time with a file browser to determine which are the older
		and newer backups.
	<li>If you cannot find the desired backup in the directory, then it could
		be in the internal device storage. This is a hidden location that can
		only be accessed on rooted devices.
	<li>If you have a rooted device, check the files in this directory:
		<span class="code">/data/data/Android/data/com.myopicmobile.textwarrior.android/files</span>.
		Some device manufacturers might set a different directory to store app 
		data. If the above directory does not exist, this is likely the case
		and you will have to figure out where the appropriate directory is.
	<li>If you are still unable to find the desired backup, the data is probably
		lost forever. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:hoon.tw@gmail.com">this address</a>
		if you believe the auto-backup feature is not working correctly.
		Your feedback will allow us to fix shortcomings and help others avoid 
		data loss situations.
	</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Backup frequency</h3>
<p>If "Auto-backup" is enabled, a backup will be made in the following scenarios:
	<ol>
	<li>Switching to another app
	<li>Entering the TextWarrior settings page
	<li>Entering the TextWarrior help page
	<li>Entering the TextWarrior file browser to open/save a file
	<li>Force close by the system
	</ol>
	With large files, auto-backup might take a while and TextWarrior may 
	appear to be unresponsive in the above scenarios. Please be patient and 
	things would be back to normal once the backup is complete.
</p>
<p>If you work regularly with large files, or want to conserve battery and
	storage space, consider turning auto-backup off to improve performance.
	However, unsaved edits will be lost if the system force-closes TextWarrior.
	This can happen when there are many apps opened and TextWarrior is not on screen.
</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
<h3>Backup locations</h3>
<p>For security reasons, the backup is made to an inaccessible location in the
	internal device storage. Only when there is not enough space will the backup
	be made to external storage. This is the SD card on most devices. Files on
	external storage are accessible by anyone.
</p>
<p>If there is not enough space in both the internal and external storage, then
	<strong>all unsaved changes will be lost forever</strong>.
</p>
<h4>Internal backup directory (accessible only on rooted devices)</h4>
<p class="code">
	/data/data/Android/data/com.myopicmobile.textwarrior.android/files
</p>
<h4>External backup directory</h4>
<p class="code">
	&lt;external store&gt;/Android/data/com.myopicmobile.textwarrior.android/files
</p>

<h2><a id = "roadmap">WHAT'S NEW</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<h3>v0.93</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Dark colour scheme available to conserve battery and increase readability
	<li>More robust backup. Previously, unsaved data could be lost if the device
		was connected to a PC and the device was running low on memory
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>v0.92</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Fixed bug: Software keyboard in numeric mode reverts to alphabetical mode
		unintentionally when a soft key is pressed
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="subsection">
	<h3>v0.91</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Auto-backup
	<li>Progress dialogs display the type of operation that is ongoing, 
		instead of a generic "Please wait" message
	<li>Feedback when replace operation is unsuccessful
	</ul>
</div>


<h2><a id = "issues">KNOWN ISSUES</a></h2>
<div class="subsection">
	<ul>
	<li>If a file is overwritten by another app while the same file is being 
		shown in TextWarrior, the displayed contents will not be updated. Worse,
		if the opened file in TextWarrior is saved, it will silently overwrite
		the latest file. To avoid this situation, always save changes before 
		replacing files with an external program
	<li>If there is not enough memory when editing text, TextWarrior will crash without saving
	<li>Word-wrap mode is not optimized. With very large files (32000+ lines or 
		>1MB), there may be a noticeable lag and progress bars may not be 
		reflective of true progress status. 
	    For better performance with huge files, consider working in non-word-wrap mode
	<li>In landscape mode, the virtual keyboard can obscure the cursor
	<li>In landscape mode, the text suggestions given by the virtual keyboard is not visible
	<li>Long-press behavior on certain Motorola hardware keyboards do not work
	<li>The cut/copy/paste buttons only apply to the main text, not the find and replace text boxes
	<li>C#: Verbatim strings are not supported
	<li>PHP: Only keywords in lowercase are recognised. Parameters passed by 
		reference are not colored. Heredoc and Nowdoc are not supported
	<li>Syntax highlighting takes a long time when the file is very large
	<li>Files containing a mix of line terminator styles may not open correctly
	</ul>
